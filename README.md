# Python Video Encoder

A simple early stage media encoder build in Python using ffmpeg to batch convert videofiles to the same LUFS, codec, framerate, bitrate, etc.

## How to install

Make sure that Python is installed on the machine. 

## Important Notes

1. Make sure that there are no spaces in the filename as then the encoder will not convert it.
2. Don't run the script on a critical broadcast computer while live as it will take up most of its CPU power when converting.
3. At this point the video needs to have an audiotrack. If there is no audiotrack the converter will not work. 

## Usage

1. Execute the `Server.py` script.
2. Add Files to the Media folder. 
3. Wait for the file to be encoded.
4. grap the new file from the `Media Destination Folder`.
5. Press 'q' to stop the script

## Config settings

An overview of the current Config file.
```json
{
    "Folder":
    {
        "Media Folder": "Media/",
        "Media Destination Folder": "MediaDestinationFolder/",
        "Garbage Folder": "GarbageFolder/"
    },
    "Aproved Extension":
        {
           "Extension":"[mp4]" 
        },
    "VideoEncoder":
        {
            "Vcodec": "libx264",
            "Fps": "59.94",
            "encoding": "veryslow",
            "Resolution":"1920:1080",
            "Bitrate":"12M",
            "Buffer":"24M"

        },
    "AudioEncoder": {
        "Acodec": "aac",
        "Bitrate": "256k",
		"LUFS Encoding":true,
		"Integrated Loudness":"-23",
		"Integrated Loudness+-":"-1",
		"Maximum loudness range":"20"
    }
}
```

`Media Folder` is the folder all new videos needs to go in to.
`Media Destination Folder` is the folder all the encoded videos are being saved at.
`Garbage Folder` is the folder the original files go to after the encoding is done.
```json
{
    "Folder":
    {
        "Media Folder": "Media/",
        "Media Destination Folder": "MediaDestinationFolder/",
        "Garbage Folder": "GarbageFolder/"
    }
}
```

All Aproved Extensions goes in here. `[mp4, mov, ....]`
```json
{
    "Aproved Extension":
        {
           "Extension":"[mp4]" 
        }
}
```

In the videoEncoder setting, the `Buffer` has to be twice the size of the bitrate.
The encoder is set to do CBR (Constant Bit Rate).
```json
{
    "VideoEncoder":
        {
            "Vcodec": "libx264",
            "Fps": "59.94",
            "encoding": "veryslow",
            "Constant Rate Factor":"18",
            "Resolution":"1920:1080",
            "Bitrate":"12M",
            "Buffer":"24M"
        }
}
```


##LUFS

The script use the build in linear normalization. see 7.70 loudnorm in https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#loudnorm
this function use:
I, Set integrated loudness target. Range is -70.0 - -5.0. Default value is -23.0.

LRA, Set loudness range target. Range is 1.0 - 20.0. Default value is 20.0.

TP, Set maximum true peak. Range is -9.0 - +0.0. Default value is -3.0.



## Log

The encoder tries to log as much as possible.


## Early stage script

While this script is used to prepare for productions it is still in its early stages and a lot will be done in the future to update.

Things in the pipeline for the future:
- UI
- Bugfixes
